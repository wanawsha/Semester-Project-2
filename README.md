# Bidster – Semester Project 2

Bidster is an auction-based web application where users can create listings, place bids, and manage their profile.  
The project was built as part of Semester Project 2 and focuses on working with APIs, authentication, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a fully functional auction site using the Noroff Auction API.  
Users can register, log in, create listings, place bids, and view their activity on a profile page.

The main goal was to demonstrate understanding of:
- API communication
- Authentication & authorization
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- State handling with localStorage
- Responsive design
